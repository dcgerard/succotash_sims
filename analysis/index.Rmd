## Known: Grid, Confounders, and Variances.

*  [Grid size of 3 with variances close together, $\pi_0$ overestimated.](alpha_sig_known.pdf)
*  [Grid size of 3 with one variance very far apart, $\pi_0$ accurately estimated.](alpha_sig_tau_known.pdf)


## Known: Grid and Confounders.

* [Variances drawn from $\chi^2_1$.](alpha_tau_known_1df_writeup.pdf)
* [Variances drawn from $\chi^2_5$.](alpha_tau_known_writeup.pdf)

## All Null Sims. Grid, Confounders, and Variance *unknown*.

* [Idealized data from SUCCOTASH model. SUCCOTASH underestimates lfdr but does better in terms of squared error loss.](count_theo_sims.pdf)
* [Same as above but using counts-per-million as output.](count_theo_sims_cpm.pdf)
* [Lung data, covariates randomized, n = 200, SUCCOTASH does best in terms of SSE and OK in terms of lfdr.](suc_v_rest_real_writeup.pdf)
* [Same as previous but with n = 40. Still best in terms of SSE but lfdr performance is horrible.](suc_v_rest_real_writeu_20v20.pdf)

## Nonnull Sims. Grid, Confounders, and Variance *unknown*.

* [Idealized data from SUCCOTASH model. SUCCOTASH underestimates $\pi_0$ but does well in terms of squared error loss.](count_theo_nonnull_cpm.pdf)
* [31 competitors, varying n, $\pi_0$, and log2fold sd. SUCCOTASH does well for AUC and worst for estimating $\pi_0$.](varyNsampNullpiLog2sd.pdf)
* [Same as previous but with smaller $n \in \{3,5\}$. SUCCOTASH performs worst in terms of $\pi_0$.](varyNsampNullpiLog2sd_smallN.pdf)
* [Explore different options for CATE. When $n = 20$, CATE does very well estimating $\pi_0$.](varyNsampNullpiLog2sd_cateonly.pdf)
* [Same as previous but with larger number of genes ($p = 10,000$). $n = 20$ is still pretty good.](varyNsampNullpiLog2sd_cateonly_10000.pdf)
* [Include SUCCOTASH (MOUTHWASH) into the CATE comparisons with $p = 1000$. Competitive in terms of AUC but horrible in terms of $\pi_0$.](varyNsampNullpiLog2sd_cateVsMouthwash.pdf)
* [Same as previous but include different regularization parameters in SUCCOTASH. Even *very* large values of $\lambda$ aren't enough.](calibrate_lambda.pdf)
* [FLASH + SUCCOTASH. Good at estimating $\pi_0$. Worse AUC than when using PCA.](varyNsampNullpiLog2sd_cateVsFlashMouthwash.pdf)
* [Homoscedastic variance factor analyses are better calibrated than heteroscedastic models](varyNsampNullpiLog2sd_cateVsMouthwashManyFA.pdf)
* [Empirically Bayesian shrinkage of the column-wise mean squared errors works better than using the raw column-wise mean squared errors, but worse than assuming homoscedasticity.](varyNsampNullpiLog2sd_cateVsMouthwashManyFA_shrinkPCA.pdf)
* [Initial sims using uniform mixtures. Variance model more important than mixing distribution. Homoscedasticity still works best.](unif_mix_compare.pdf)
* [SUCCOTASH vs ASH with homoscedastic and heteroscedastic assumptions and n = 10,000. Homoscedastic models are better calibrated but have worse AUC. SUCCOTASH generally has higher AUC](big_sims_mouth_largen_writeup.html)
* [Same as above but also including methods using limma-shrunk column-wise mean square as variance estimates.](big_sims_mouth_ashVsucc_writeup.html)

## Other Implementation Checks.

* [Gives same results as `ashr` when no confounders.](check_with_ash.pdf)
* [An example where SUCCOTASH performs poorly](succotash_ests.html)
* [Grid is known, SUCCOTASH performs well](known_grid.html)
* [t-likelihood seems to be implemented correctly](test_tlike.pdf)
